monad-resumption
=================

This library implements resumption and reactive resumption monads for use in resumption-passing style programming in Haskell.  For more information on the basis behind Resumptions in Haskell, [Cheap (But Functional) Threads](http://people.cs.missouri.edu/~harrisonwl/drafts/CheapThreads.pdf) is an advisable read.
